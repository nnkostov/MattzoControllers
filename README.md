# MattzoControllers

**Smart controllers for automating LEGO and brick train layouts**

MattzoControllers are WiFi-enabled microcontroller devices that connect your LEGO trains and layout accessories to train automation software like [Rocrail](https://www.rocrail.net/). They act as a bridge between your physical LEGO components and digital train control systems.

## üöÇ What Can MattzoControllers Do?

- **Control trains** via Bluetooth (LEGO Powered Up, SBrick, BuWizz2) or Power Functions
- **Operate layout accessories** like switches, signals, and level crossings
- **Monitor sensors** to detect train positions and trigger automated actions
- **Connect wirelessly** to your train automation software via WiFi and MQTT
- **Provide remote control** using LEGO remotes for manual operation

## üì¶ Controller Types

This repository contains firmware for three types of MattzoControllers:

### MTC4BT (Mattzo Train Controller for Bluetooth)
- **Purpose**: Controls Bluetooth-enabled train devices
- **Supported devices**: LEGO Powered Up, SBrick, BuWizz2, LEGO Remote Control
- **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller (required for Bluetooth)
- **Use case**: Modern LEGO trains with Bluetooth connectivity

### MTC4PF (Mattzo Train Controller for Power Functions)
- **Purpose**: Controls LEGO Power Functions trains
- **Supported devices**: LEGO Power Functions motors and lights
- **Hardware**: ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller
- **Use case**: Older LEGO trains using Power Functions system

### MLC (MattzoLayoutController)
- **Purpose**: Controls layout accessories and monitors sensors
- **Supported devices**: Servos (switches), LEDs (signals), sensors, level crossings
- **Hardware**: ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller + expansion boards
- **Use case**: Layout automation and accessory control

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

### For MTC4BT (Bluetooth Controller)
- **ESP32 development board** (Bluetooth required)
  - Tested boards: AZDelivery ESP32 NodeMCU, DOIT DEVKIT V1 ESP32-WROOM-32
- **Optional**: W5500 Ethernet module for wired connection
- **LEGO devices**: Powered Up hubs, SBrick, BuWizz2, or LEGO Remote Control

### For MTC4PF (Power Functions Controller)
- **ESP8266 or ESP32 development board**
- **Motor driver board** (L298N, L9110, or LEGO IR transmitter)
- **LEGO Power Functions**: Motors, lights, and receivers

### For MLC (Layout Controller)
- **ESP8266 or ESP32 development board**
- **PCA9685 PWM driver** (for servos/switches)
- **MCP23017 I/O expander** (optional, for more sensors)
- **Servos, LEDs, sensors** as needed for your layout

## üíª Software Setup

### Step 1: Install Development Environment

1. **Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**

2. **Install PlatformIO extension**:
   - Open VS Code
   - Click the Extensions icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search for "PlatformIO IDE"
   - Click "Install"

3. **Open the project**:
   - Download or clone this repository
   - In VS Code: File ‚Üí Open Workspace from File
   - Select `MattzoControllers.code-workspace`

### Step 2: Configure Your Controller

Each controller needs two configuration files in the `conf/my/` directory:

1. **Create the `my` folder**:
   ```
   src/[controller-type]/conf/my/
   ```

2. **Copy template files**:
   - Copy `network_config.h` from `conf/default/` to `conf/my/`
   - Copy `controller_config.h` from `conf/default/` to `conf/my/`

3. **Edit network configuration** (`network_config.h`):
   ```cpp
   const char* WIFI_SSID = "YourWiFiName";
   const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourWiFiPassword";
   const char* MQTT_BROKER_IP = "192.168.1.100";  // Your Rocrail computer IP
   ```

4. **Edit controller configuration** (`controller_config.h`):
   - Configure pins, addresses, and device settings
   - See example files in `conf/examples/` for inspiration

### Step 3: Build and Upload Firmware

1. **Connect your microcontroller** via USB

2. **Select environment** in PlatformIO:
   - For ESP32: `esp32`
   - For ESP8266: `esp8266` (if available)

3. **Build and upload**:
   - Click the PlatformIO icon in VS Code
   - Click "Upload" for your environment

## üîß Basic Operation

### First Boot
1. **Power on** your controller
2. **Check status LED**: Should blink to indicate WiFi connection attempts
3. **Monitor serial output** (115200 baud) for connection status and errors

### Connecting to Rocrail
1. **Configure Rocrail** to connect to your MQTT broker
2. **Add controllers** in Rocrail with matching addresses from your config
3. **Test communication** by sending commands from Rocrail

### For MTC4BT (Bluetooth)
1. **Power on LEGO devices** (Powered Up hubs, SBrick, etc.)
2. **Controller will auto-discover** and connect to configured devices
3. **LED colors** on LEGO Remote indicate connection status:
   - Flashing: Searching for controller
   - 50% on/off: Connected but layout power off
   - Solid on: Connected and ready

### For MTC4PF (Power Functions)
1. **Connect motor drivers** and LEGO components according to your config
2. **Test train control** from Rocrail
3. **Adjust power levels** in configuration if needed

### For MLC (Layout Controller)
1. **Connect servos, LEDs, and sensors** according to your wiring config
2. **Test switches and signals** from Rocrail
3. **Monitor sensor feedback** in Rocrail

## üîç Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
- Check SSID and password in `network_config.h`
- Ensure 2.4GHz WiFi (5GHz not supported)
- Check signal strength at controller location

### MQTT Connection Issues
- Verify MQTT broker IP address
- Check firewall settings on Rocrail computer
- Ensure MQTT broker is running

### Device Not Responding
- Check power supply (stable 5V recommended)
- Verify pin configurations match your wiring
- Monitor serial output for error messages

### Bluetooth Issues (MTC4BT)
- Ensure ESP32 board (ESP8266 doesn't support Bluetooth)
- Check device addresses in configuration
- Power cycle LEGO devices if connection fails
